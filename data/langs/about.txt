Thanks to the people who contributed to the project through these translations!

However, as the system is time-consuming to maintain and the translations are now largely out of date, this translation system will be discontinued on a gradual basis as new versions of the software are released.

Therefore, while I sincerely thank those who have contributed, please do not submit new translations of the software.

Thank you
